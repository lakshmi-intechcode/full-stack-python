## Add a feature to your Terminal Trader

Here's an open ended challenge if you have time - add a feature to your Terminal Trader app. If you think you need refactoring before adding any features, you're probably right. Do it!

When you're ready, here are some ideas:

* Add [Options](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)) to the type of equity assets a user can buy. The most common types of options are [put options](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Put_option) and [call options](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_option).

* Allow the user to place a [stop-loss order](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp) on any stock they hold in their portfolio

* Save the user's total portfolio value minimum every time they log in, maximum once a day. Graph this data in terminal using something like Blessings or even better, generate a SVG using Python's super intuitive plotting library [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

* Add Crypto-currency, ie. Bitcoin, to the type of assets a user can buy. Use the [Coinmarketcap api](http://coinmarketcap-nexuist.rhcloud.com/) to get this data. See also [Coinmarketcap.com](http://www.coinmarketcap.com)
