## Bank your market cash!

If you haven't finished your Terminal Trader or Bank Software do that now. This challenge assumes you have working versions of both.

In this challenge, we are going to link our Terminal Trader to the Bank Software we wrote earlier this week. Players should be able to link their bank credentials to Terminal trader. Then they should be able to withdraw their liquid cash from Terminal Trader into any of their bank accounts.

If they try to link to a non-existent bank account they should get an error. They should also get an error, if they try to withdraw amounts greater than what they have, negative amounts, etc.

Keep the db files separate. No copy paste - import any necessary functionality between the two, but keep them decoupled for normal use.

Do not be afraid to refactor your code or make it more OO. You're going to need everything organized to add this feature or you will just add more technical debt. Refactoring before moving forward, a lot of times, will save you time.
