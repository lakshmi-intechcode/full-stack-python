Week 3 Day 4
============

Today we will be bringing together everything we've learned so far. We'll also be reaching out to the internet for data for the very first time. 

We're going to need to go outside Python's core library for the very first time. This means installing the Python package manager, [Pip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager)).

To install Pip on Ubuntu:

`sudo apt-get install python3-pip`

Mac Users, if you installed Python3 using Homebrew than you should already have Pip installed.

To install a package with pip, just enter in your terminal:

`pip3 install [package-name]`
