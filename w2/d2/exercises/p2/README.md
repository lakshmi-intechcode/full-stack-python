## Queue

Wikipedia on [queues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)).

The opposite of the Stack, the Queue is a FIFO data structure - First In, First Out.

#### Visualization

A music playlist works like a queue.

		|Dio - Holy Diver|

The enqueue operation will add a song to the end. The dequeue operation will pop off the front.

#### Implementation

You will need to create a Queue class that holds the following methods: 

- enqueue

- dequeue 

- is_empty 

- get_front.
