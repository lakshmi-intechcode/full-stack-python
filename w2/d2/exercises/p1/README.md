Stack
=====

Wikipedia on [stacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)).  

Similarly, the Linked List, a stack is an abstract data type. It is LIFO, or Last In First Out. Each node holds data and a pointer to the next node.

The main operations available to the Stack are push and pop. 
- Pop should remove the top node and return it. 
- Push should add to the top of the stack.

###Methods

Create your datatypes and create the following methods:

- push - adds to the stack

- pop - removes from the top of the stack

- peek - Find the item at the top of the stack

- empty - Is the stack empty?

###Additional Methods

In the wikipedia article, read under the title "Hardware Stacks". Emulating a hardware stack, add the operations it lists to your class. This is open ended and implementation is up to you.
