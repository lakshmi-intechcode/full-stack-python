Week 2 Day 2
============

Happy Tuesday!

Today we will be recreating a few data structures as well as two basic search algorithms. We will also be talking about Big O. Big O is important to have a basic understanding of. The complexities of Big O aren't too important at this level, so our goal is to understand it's implications once we begin to build scalable applications.

#### Summary

A **data structure** is a particular way of storing and organizing data so that it can be used efficiently. Data structures are usually categorized as primitive, composite or abstract.  
**Searching** for data is one of the fundamental fields of computing. Often, the difference between a fast program and a slow one is the use of a good algorithm for the data set.


#### Learning Competencies

* Understand the types of data structures.
* Implement the Linked List, Stack, Queue, & Binary Tree data structures in Python.
* Determine when to use a particular data structure.
