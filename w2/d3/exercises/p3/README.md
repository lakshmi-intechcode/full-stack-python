## Linear Search

Write a linear search. Start at the front or the back of the array and iterate through until you find the item you're searching for. 

You can use any method of your choice to accomplish this. 

#### Things to consider

As you're coding, ask yourself...
* What is the expected Big-O of this search?
* Do I understand this algorithm?
* Could I explain it to a 5 year old in less than 5 sentences?
